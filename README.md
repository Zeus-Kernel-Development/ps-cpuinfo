# ps-cpuinfo v2.4.1 - CPU Info like Microde by Powershell

#### I made a few modificitions:
- Add tenforums URL in the description of the script
- Rewritten the registry code for make it work on older powershell versions
- add a pause to the end of the script so you could use "run with powershell" (right-click)
